In this episode we implemented a proof of work algorithm for our blockchain. 

The proof of work algorithm is used to secure the blockchain by making it difficult to corrupt the blockchain, since it would require re-mining all the blocks that came after the block that was tampered with.

also it is used to validate the transactions by the nodes in the network.
